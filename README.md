>ðŸ“‹  Abstract:
Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide rich spectral-spatial information with stacked hundreds of contiguous narrowbands. Due to the existence of noise and band correlation, the selection of informative spectral-spatial kernel features poses a challenge. This is often addressed by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with receptive field (RF) having fixed sizes. However, these solutions cannot enable neurons to effectively adjust RF sizes and cross-channel dependencies when forward and backward propagations are used to optimize the network. In this article, we present an attention-based adaptive spectral-spatial kernel improved residual network (AÂ²SÂ²K-ResNet) with spectral attention to capture discriminative spectral-spatial features for HSI classification in an end-to-end training fashion. In particular, the proposed network learns selective 3-D convolutional kernels to jointly extract spectral-spatial features using improved 3-D ResBlocks and adopts an efficient feature recalibration (EFR) mechanism to boost the classification performance. Extensive experiments are performed on three well-known hyperspectral data sets, i.e., IP, KSC, and UP, and the proposed AÂ²SÂ²K-ResNet can provide better classification results in terms of overall accuracy (OA), average accuracy (AA), and Kappa compared with the existing methods investigated.
